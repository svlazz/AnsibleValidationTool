## Variables

In this playbook, the variables that you may need to adjust are found in the tasks where specific configuration files are copied for your environment. You can modify the file paths, email addresses for SSL certificate configuration, and other settings according to your specific needs.

## Use Cases

This Ansible playbook is designed to configure an Apache web server on remote hosts. Some of the use cases include:

- Initial setup of an Apache web server on a new server.
- Updating an existing Apache web server with new configurations and packages.
- Automating common Apache configuration tasks, such as installing modules, setting permissions, and managing virtual hosts.
- Implementing additional security measures, such as configuring firewalls, fail2ban, and SSL.

## Description

This Ansible playbook provides a series of tasks to configure and optimize an Apache web server on remote hosts. The playbook performs the following actions:

1. Updates the system's package list.
2. Installs Apache and PHP along with necessary modules and packages.
3. Removes the default index.html file and copies a sample index.php file (you must provide the index.php file).
4. Configures appropriate permissions for the web directory.
5. Enables the mod_php module and restarts the Apache service.
6. Opens port 80 in the firewall (you can enable this if you are using ufw).
7. Provides optional settings to configure HTTPS with SSL certificate, additional security rules, log rotation, installation of server monitoring tools, fail2ban configuration, database backup, system alerts, additional Apache modules, additional virtual hosts configuration, and log analysis tools like GoAccess.

This playbook can be used as a foundation to efficiently configure and maintain Apache web servers.
